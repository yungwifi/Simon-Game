# Technologies Used 

JavaScript, Asynchronus JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Materialize, and HTML

# Biggest Problems 

THE biggest problem I ran into during this project as having to learn Asycnchronus Javascript. The other problems I ran into were placement of the functions I was calling. There were a couple instances where I was calling a function in the right place at the time, but down the road as my code progressed the placement of that function created problems for me and I had to rethink it's placement.

# Lessons Learned 
BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND. I start out this project trying to solve a piece of everything and then just putting it together in the end. That was cool because I was able to write a lot of functions but once it came time to put all the pieces together I was lost and ended up breaking my code. I learned how important it is to plan at the begining and how important it is to stick to that plan, no matter how simple the task at hand is.

# Phase 2 
Phase 2 I would like to be able to create the sequence to be played back for each round and the user have to follow the sequence in order to move forward in rounds. I would also like to include a visible and actual timer that forces the user give the answer in the amount of time displayed and if they fail to do so, the game will end and reset.. And finally I would like to add a cheat code, a visible round indentifier,and high score box.
