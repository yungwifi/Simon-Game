# Technologies Used 

JavaScript, Asynchronus JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Materialize, and HTML

# Biggest Problems 

THE biggest problem I ran into during this project as having to learn Asycnchronus Javascript. The other problems I ran into were placement of the functions I was calling. There were a couple instances where I was calling a function in the right place at the time, but down the road as my code progressed the placement of that function created problems for me and I had to rethink it's placement.
