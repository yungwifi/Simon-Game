# Technologies Used 

JavaScript, Asynchronus JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Materialize, and HTML

# Biggest Problems 

THE biggest problem I ran into during this project as having to learn Asycnchronus Javascript. The other problems I ran into were placement of the functions I was calling. There were a couple instances where I was calling a function in the right place at the time, but down the road as my code progressed the placement of that function created problems for me and I had to rethink it's placement.

# Lessons Learned 
BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND. I start out this project trying to solve a piece of everything and then just putting it together in the end. That was cool because I was able to write a lot of functions but once it came time to put all the pieces together I was lost and ended up breaking my code. I learned how important it is to plan at the begining and how important it is to stick to that plan, no matter how simple the task at hand is.
